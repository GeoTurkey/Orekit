In order to use Apex to launch Skat simulations, you should follow the follwing steps:

 - unzip the skat-xxx-bin.zip archive in whatever folder you want,
   where xxx corresponds to skat version (if you can read this
   README file, you have probably already done this)
   this should create a skat-xxx folder containing a skat-xxx.jar
   file, and several subfolders (apex, licenses, lib, orekit-data,
   reference-use-cases)

 - unzip the apex-core-yyy-bin.zip archive in whatever folder you want,
   where yyy corresponds to apex version
   this should create an apex-core-yyy folder containing an apex-core-yyy.jar
   file, and several subfolders (licenses, lib)

 - go to the skat-xxx/apex subfolder extracted from the first
   archive (this is where this README file is)

 - assuming you have unzipped the two archives in the same folder
   and hence the two skat-xxx and apex-core-yyy folders are side by side,
   you can launch apex using the following command line:

   java -jar ../../apex-core-yyy/apex-core-yyy.jar -verbose -batch geo-cross-coupling.apx

   the -verbose flag means apex will display the skat runs start time,
   end time and duration

 - at the end of the apex run, the results should be available in a
   geo-cross-coupling.stats file
